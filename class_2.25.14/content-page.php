<!-- 
This is where you add the HTML for how you want the content of your page to appear.
Some template tags you might want to use:

	<?php the_title(); ?>

	<?php the_post_thumbnail('feature-image' ); ?> Change feature-image to whatever name you defined for the featured image
	<?php the_content(); ?>


Keep this page pretty simple. You just need it to show the content of your page mainly.

Add your content below. You should delete all of this once you do.
