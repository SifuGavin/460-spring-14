MMP 460 Spring 2014
=============

This repository will house the class files for spring 2014. In order to make it easier to download files for a particular class session or resource it is organized differently than most repositories.

Instead of having a master branch of the project with all files and other branches with variations, almost all files are stored in branches and those branches are each different from each other. To see files for a class find the branch for that class and then you can download the files or view them or whatever.
